My name is Francesca Romana, and I'm a data scientist working in healthcare :computer: :dna: :stethoscope:

I hold a PhD from the Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology at Imperial College London, where my research focused on developing patient-centred technologies for personalised healthcare. Now I work to use rich datasets and advanced computational methods to create more personalised, effective, and accessible healthcare solutions.

Here you can find all about me and my work :sparkles:

## UPDATE: I wrote a book!
### Enabling Patient-Centred Approaches in the Management and Prevention of Lifestyle-Related Conditions
Soon available [here](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003464983/technologies-personalised-healthcare-francesca-romana-cavallo-christofer-toumazou).

**A little sneak peek...**
This book explores how personalised healthcare can be realised with the integration of new and established technologies, and how novel methods can be developed to improve health outcomes in lifestyle-related conditions.

Technologies for Personalised Healthcare: Enabling Patient-Centred Approaches in the Management and Prevention of Lifestyle-Related Conditions explores various aspects of personalised healthcare in the context of lifestyle-related conditionsâ€”from how statistics and machine learning can be used to extrapolate clinically useful stratifications from big data, to how adaptive AI can enable behaviour change; from how biosensors and point-of-care devices can bring diagnostics closer to the patient, to the ethical aspects of personalised medicine. The highly multidisciplinary nature of the book gives the reader a broad view on established and emerging technologies for personalised healthcare. It provides the technical background underpinning these technologies, while case studies present practical applications of the methods discussed. The content and worked examples found within this book can serve as a reference guide on the technologies and methods needed to tap into the endless opportunities to be realised within personalised healthcare.

This book is intended for researchers and academics that want to know more about how they can apply computational methods and electronics within the field of personalised healthcare. It is also for those who are interested in the bridge between technology, engineering, and medicine.
