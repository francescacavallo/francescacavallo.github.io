My name is Francesca Romana, and I am a Research Associate in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Imperial College School of Public Health.
I am interested in using rich datasets and advanced computational methods to create more personalised, effective, and accessible healthcare solutions.  :computer: :dna: :stethoscope:

Previously, I was a Senior Data Scientist at Optum UK, where I worked closely with the NHS to develop predictive models of medical risk.

I hold a PhD from the Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology at Imperial College London, where my research focused on developing patient-centred technologies for personalised healthcare. 

Here you can find all about me and my work :sparkles:

## UPDATE: I wrote a book!
### Technologies for Personalised Healthcare: Enabling Patient-Centred Approaches in the Management and Prevention of Lifestyle-Related Conditions
Soon available [here](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003464983/technologies-personalised-healthcare-francesca-romana-cavallo-christofer-toumazou).
